        The first character is good enough to determine a straight

    # Second character for the suit S (Spade), H (Heart), D (Diamond), C (Clubs)

    # Instead break it down into two sub functions is_straight and is_flush

    # best hand of these 3 would be a straight flush with the return value 3
    # the second best would be a flush with the return value 2

    # any other hand would be the fourth best with the return value 0
    # max in poker function uses these return values to select the best hand
